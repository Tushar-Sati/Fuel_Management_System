# Review Comments

## Final Review Notes

### General Observations
1. The code structure is well-organized and follows the standard MVC pattern.
2. Documentation is clear and easy to follow, especially the `README.md` and `API_Documentation.md`.

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Database Connection Handling
- Ensure all database connections are properly closed in a `finally` block or use try-with-resources.

#### 2. Exception Handling
- Add more specific exception messages for database and service errors.

#### 3. Unit Test Coverage
- Some edge cases are missing in the unit tests, such as:
  - Negative or zero quantity for fuels in `FuelServiceTest`.
  - Missing fields in user registration tests in `UserServiceTest`.

#### 4. Validation
- Enhance validation in Servlets to include checks for email format, password strength, etc.

#### 5. Security
- Ensure passwords are hashed before being stored in the database.
- Implement HTTPS for secure communication.

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Logging**: Add logging for key operations and errors using a framework like Log4j or SLF4J.
2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for endpoints like `GET /fuels` and `GET /transactions` to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Frontend**: Include more user-friendly error messages and input validation in JSP pages.

### Approval Status
- The project is functional and ready for deployment after addressing the above improvements.
