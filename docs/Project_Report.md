# Project Report

## Fuel Management System

### Overview
The Fuel Management System is designed to streamline the management of fuels, transactions, and user interactions. It is built using Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL, ensuring robust functionality and ease of use. This project showcases CRUD operations, business logic layers, and integration of modern development frameworks.

---

### Features
1. **Fuel Management**
   - Add, update, and delete fuel types.
   - View all available fuels.

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Record purchases, sales, and refills of fuels.
   - View all transactions or filter by fuel type.

3. **User Management**
   - User registration and profile management.
   - Secure data handling for user credentials.

4. **Web Application Integration**
   - Dynamic JSP pages for user interactions.
   - JSTL and EL for simplified data presentation.

5. **Database Integration**
   - MySQL database for persistent data storage.
   - Optimized queries for seamless CRUD operations.

---

### Architecture
- **Presentation Layer**: JSPs for UI and Servlets for handling HTTP requests.
- **Business Layer**: Service classes encapsulating business logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: DAO classes interacting with the MySQL database.

---

### Technologies Used
1. **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 11)
2. **Database**: MySQL 8.0
3. **Frameworks and Libraries**:
   - Servlet API
   - JSP and JSTL
   - JUnit 5 for testing
   - Mockito for mocking dependencies
4. **Development Tools**:
   - IntelliJ IDEA
   - Apache Maven

---

### Database Schema
#### Tables
1. **Fuel**:
   - `fuel_id` (Primary Key)
   - `type` (VARCHAR)
   - `quantity` (DOUBLE)

2. **Transaction**:
   - `transaction_id` (Primary Key)
   - `fuel_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `transaction_type` (ENUM: 'purchase', 'sale', 'refill')
   - `amount` (DOUBLE)
   - `transaction_date` (TIMESTAMP)

3. **Users**:
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `username` (VARCHAR)
   - `email` (VARCHAR)
   - `password` (VARCHAR)

---

### Testing
1. **Unit Testing**
   - DAO and Service layers tested using JUnit 5.
   - Mocked dependencies for isolated testing.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verified end-to-end interactions between layers.
   - Checked database consistency after operations.

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Validated UI flows and API endpoints.

---

### Future Enhancements
1. Add user authentication and role-based access control.
2. Implement RESTful APIs for external integrations.
3. Enhance UI using modern frameworks like React or Angular.
4. Add real-time data analytics for fuel usage and transactions.

---

### Conclusion
The Fuel Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing fuel inventories, transactions, and users. It demonstrates the use of core Java concepts, database connectivity, and modern web development techniques. This project is scalable and can be extended for advanced use cases in the future.
